## What CodeMeta IS

CodeMeta is a "[Rosetta Stone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosetta_Stone)", i.e., a translation medium, for software metadata.

## What CodeMeta ISN'T

- CodeMeta is **not** a new standard! Instead, it is designed to **foster collaboration and interoperability** of metadata standards

## Rationale: Why CodeMeta?

CodeMeta exists to

-  **incentivise** Research Software Engineers and domain scientists developing software to **release their software into the open**
- allow research software to be **cited more easily**
- **increase discoverability** of research software
- allow people to **build tools** that use the metadata, e.g., for indexing, dependency checking, etc.

## Does CodeMeta have a format?

- There is a [JSON-LD representation](../../blob/master/codemeta.jsonld) for CodeMeta.

### What can I do with the CodeMeta format?

- **[Discoverability]** Build a searchable index or repository of [CodeMeta-compatible projects](#what-does-"codemeta-compatible"-mean?)
- **[Discovery]** Easily track and compare dependencies and licenses of [CodeMeta-compatible projects](#what-does-"codemeta-compatible"-mean?)
- **Add your idea here!** 

### What does "CodeMeta-compatible" mean?

# How to contribute

Please either contact us, or fork the repository and create a pull request (or both).
***WHAT CONTACT DETAILS SHOULD BE LINKED TO HERE?***

# CodeMeta for developers

You can build tools for, e.g., indexing software via their metadata. CodeMeta helps you to use metadata from different sources.

## Create an implementation

`[TBD]` Link to the spec

## Use a CodeMeta library

`[TBD]` Is there such a thing? This section should include links to source, download, and a tutorial

## Add a new format

Please contact us if you want a new format to be added to CodeMeta.


# CodeMeta for repository managers

You can make use of CodeMeta's Rosetta Stone quality to figure out suitable standards for your own metadata schema.

# Contributers, funders, acknowledgments, etc.
